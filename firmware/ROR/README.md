ROR-Pi-Pico.ino - while debugging ROR we found it was very sensitive to noise turning the relay on or off. since the logic was all embedded electrically with a hardware counter its difficult to modify too much. So this is an attempt to plug in the RF stage of ROR to a pi Pico and connecting the relay to it as an output which allows us to have full control over the receiver logic through firmware.
